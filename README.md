Finally, the teacher's personal information is coming, and two academic recommenders have been selected. Now I'm waiting for the news from the agency. Today, I also went through the RFID final exam. Although I reviewed for a long time, I didn't expect that the teacher gave me 8 points for four empty questions when I got the exam questions. I don't know the details, Anyway, I'll write everything on my back. That's it
